                Self-love is one of the most talked-about concepts today. People
                are encouraged to prioritize their well-being, embrace
                self-care, and set boundaries. While this is essential for a
                balanced life, there is a thin line between healthy self-love
                and self-worship â€” an extreme form of self-centeredness where
                personal desires, opinions, and emotions are placed above
                everything else.

                As a marriage counselor and a believer in Christ, I have seen
                how the decision of whom to marry shapes not just the lives of
                individuals but also their destiny, purpose, and service to God.
